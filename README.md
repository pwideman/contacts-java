# Sample Java Contacts app

Build the app by running:
 
### `mvnw install`
 
from the command line, in the app root directory. JAVA_HOME needs to be defined for this script to work.\
This will build the output jar in the `/target` directory.

Run the app by running:

### `java -jar contacts-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

It will run on http://localhost:8080. Test the server using the related `contacts-app-react` app.
